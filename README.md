Sumary:- Work In Progress

2) Find, run and extend a notebook in seedbank and share along with your comments on what you learned.

I have got exposed to colab. The code is there for us to run and look at the results. 
Dataset for Fashion has to be downloaded first into Colab environment.
Tensorflow, Numpy, Distutils packages were imported in Python code
Model was defined with layers
Then comes training the model.Construct the Model on the TPU and compile it
Inferences to be drawn from the model results
